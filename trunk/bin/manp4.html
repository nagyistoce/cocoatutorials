<b>% p4 help charset</b>
	
	The Perforce clients and server have an optional mode of operation
	where all metadata and some file content are stored in the server
	in the UTF8 Unicode character set and are translated into another
	character set on the client.

	The environment variable P4CHARSET controls the client character
	set.  Supported values are:

		eucjp
		iso8859-1
		iso8859-5
		iso8859-15
		macosroman
		shiftjis
		koi8-r
		utf8 		(UTF-8)
		utf8-bom	(UTF-8 with Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf16		(UTF-16 with client's byte ordering
					 and Byte-OrderMark)
		utf16-nobom	(UTF-16 client's byte ordering
					 without Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf16le		(UTF-16 with little endian byte ordering)
		utf16le-bom	(UTF-16 with little endian Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf16be		(UTF-16 with big endian byte ordering)
		utf16be-bom	(UTF-16 with big endian Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf32		(UTF-32 with client's byte ordering
					 and Byte-OrderMark)
		utf32-nobom	(UTF-32 client's byte ordering
					 without Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf32le		(UTF-32 with little endian byte ordering)
		utf32le-bom	(UTF-32 with little endian Byte-Order-Mark)
		utf32be		(UTF-32 with big endian byte ordering)
		utf32be-bom	(UTF-32 with big endian Byte-Order-Mark)
		cp1251		(Windows code page 1251)
		winansi		(Windows code page 1252)

	If (and only if) P4CHARSET is set for the client, the server
	must also be operating in Unicode mode.  This mode is switched
	on (and never off) by invoking 'p4d -xi' on the server.  This
	operation verifies that all existing metadata is valid UTF8,
	and then sets the protected counter 'unicode' to indicate Unicode
	mode.

	In Unicode mode, all non-file data (identifiers, descriptions,
	etc) and the content of files of type 'unicode' are translated
	between the P4CHARSET character set on the client and UTF8 in
	the server.

	P4CHARSET is supported by 2001.2 and later clients.

	When P4CHARSET is set to one of the UTF-16 values, use of
	the command line 'p4' will require setting P4COMMANDCHARSET
	to a non-utf-16 value.  This allows P4CHARSET to control the
	translation of file revision contents while using a command
	line system which is not utf-16 based as most commands lines
	are not utf-16 compatible.  All UTF-16 values will honor
	a file's Byte-Order-Mark when a file is being read, but
	when a file is being written the specified UTF-16 format
	will be followed.

<b>% p4 help filetypes</b>
	
    File types supported by Perforce:

	Perforce understands a variety of files, indicated by a file's
	filetype, which determines how the file is handled on both the
	client and the server.

	A filetype can be given either alone as 'type' or with specific
	modifiers 'type+mods'.  A partial filetype, used to modify other
	filetypes, is just the modifiers '+mods'.

	The following are the base filetypes:

	    Type        Client Use           Server Storage
	    ----        ----------           --------------
	    text        newlines translated  deltas in RCS format
	    binary      raw bytes            compressed binary
	    symlink     symbolic link        deltas in RCS format
	    apple       Mac resource + data  compressed AppleSingle
	    resource    Mac resource fork    compressed binary
	    unicode     newlines translated  deltas in RCS format
	                                     stored as UTF-8
	    utf16	newlines translated  deltas in RCS format
	                client file UTF-16   stored as UTF-8
			in client byte order unless BOM overrides
			File is always written with a BOM
			A BOM is needed for automatic type detection

	The following are the modifiers:

	    Modifier    Meaning
	    --------    -------
	    +m		always set modtime on client
			(overrides client's nomodtime)
	    +w          always writable on client
	    +x          exec bit set on client

	    +k		$Keyword$ expansion of Id, Header, Author
			Date, DateTime, Change, File, Revision
	    +ko         $Keyword$ expansion of Id, Header only
	    +l		exclusive open: disallow multiple opens

	    +C          server stores compressed file per revision
	    +D          server stores deltas in RCS format
	    +F          server stores full file per revision
	    +S          server stores only single head revision
	    +S<n>       server stores <n> number of revisions, where <n>
	                is a number 1-10 or 16,32,64,128,256,512.

	The following type aliases exist for backwards compatibility:

	For a default '<a href="#edit">p4 edit</a>' and '<a href="#reopen">p4 reopen</a>' reuse the current file
	filetype, and '<a href="#add">p4 add</a>' senses the filetype by examining the
	file's contents and execute permission bits.

	If a filetype is given as a partial filetype, with '+mods' only,
	then that filetype is combined with, rather than replaces, the
	default.  Most modifiers are simply added to the default type,
	but the storage modifiers +C, +D, and +F replace the storage
	method.  It is not possible to remove a modifier with a partial

<b>% p4 help jobview</b>
	
    Perforce job views:

	A job view is an expression that selects jobs according to word
	and date matches.  Job views are used by the '<a href="#jobs">p4 jobs</a>' -e flag
	to select which jobs to display.  Also, the '<a href="#user">p4 user</a>' form
	contains a JobView field which selects which jobs are to be
	presented during changelist creation for automatic closing upon
	changelist submission.

	'<a href="#job">p4 job</a>' indexes all whitespace-separated words, and then any
	punctuation-separated words within those words.  So 'sub-par'
	is entered into the index as 'sub', 'par', and 'sub-par'.  Case
	is not considered. '<a href="#job">p4 job</a>' separately indexes all date fields
	in a way that allows searching for a range of dates.

	In its simplest form, a job view can contain a list of words,
	separated by spaces, that must appear in a job for it to be
	selected.  For a match to occur all words must appear somewhere
	in the job, not including date fields:

		JobView: GUI redrawing bug
		p4 jobs -e 'GUI redrawing bug'

	To select a particular field, the 'field=word' syntax may be used:

		JobView: GUI redrawing status=open 

	Logical operators & (and), | (or), ^ (not), and () (grouping)
	may also be used; spaces remain a low-precedence 'and' operator:

		JobView: redrawing (type=bug|type=sir) status=open

	The ^ (not) operator cannot be used alone or with | (or), only
	in conjuction with & (and) or space (and):

		JobView: type=bug & ^status=closed

	Comparative operators >, >=, <, <=, and = are permitted.  Because
	they succeed if any word in the field matches, only the = operator
	is useful against fields containing blocks of text:

		JobView: priority<=b description=gui

	Text searches may embed the wildcard *, which matches anything:

		JobView: redraw* type=bug

	To match operator characters, you can escape them with \.

	Date fields may be searched using comparative operators.  Dates
	are of the form yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm:ss.  If a specific
	time is not given, the equality operators (=, <=, >=) match the
	whole day:

		JobView: reported_date>=1998/01/01 status=closed

	Text field comparisons are done alphabetically. Date field 
	comparisons are done chronologically.

<b>% p4 help revisions</b>

    Specifying file revisions and revision ranges:

	Some file-related Perforce client commands can limit their actions
	to specific file revisions.  A revision specification is tacked
	onto the end of the filename, and is one of the following:

	    #rev - A revision number.
	    @change - A change number: the revision as of that change.
	    @client - A client name: the revision on the client.
	    @label - A label name: the revision in the label.
	    @date - A date or date/time: the revision as of that time.
		Either yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm:ss
		Note that yyyy/mm/dd means yyyy/mm/dd:00:00:00,
		so if you want to include all events on that day refer
		to the next day.

	#rev has special variants, to be used literally:

	    #none - A nonexistent revision (also #0).
	    #head - The current head revision.
	    #have - The revision on the current client.

	In all cases, if a file doesn't exist at the given revision number
	it appears as if the file doesn't exist at all. Thus using a label
	to refer to a file that isn't in the label is indistinguishable
	from referring to file that doesn't exist at all.

	If no revision specification is given, the default is usually #head.

	A revision specification can be given without a filename. This
	limits the command's action to the specified revision of all files
	in the depot or in the client's workspace.  Thus #head refers to
	the head revision of all files in the depot, and @label refers
	to the revisions of all files in the named label.

	Some commands can limit their actions to a range of revision numbers,
	rather than just a single revision.  A revision range is two revision
	specifications, separated by a comma (,).  If a single revision is
	given where a revision range is expected, then the named revision
	specifies the end of the range and the beginning is left at #1.
	'<a href="#obliterate">p4 obliterate</a>' is an exception: a single revision means exactly
	that revision.

	If no revision number or range is given where a revision range is
	expected, the default is all revisions.

	it amenable to scripting.

	The -u flag specifies the user name, overriding the value of
	$P4USER, $USER, and $USERNAME in the environment.

	The -x flag instructs p4 to read arguments, one per line, from the

    Perforce views:

	A Perforce view maps file names from the depot into the client
	workspace (for a client view) or into another part of the depot
	(for a branch view).

	A view is one or more mappings, and each mapping is a pair of file
	names on a line.  The left side always refers to the depot namespace;
	the right side refers to the client or depot namespace.  Each name
	is in Perforce syntax, meaning it begins with // and the client or
	depot name, and is followed by the actual file name within the
	client or depot.   Perforce syntax uses /'s as directory separators.
	e.g.  //depot/dir/file.c

	Mappings can contain wildcards, as long as the wildcards are matched
	between the left and right sides.  The wildcards are:

		*               matches any characters except /
		...             matches any characters, including /
		%%1 to %%9      like *, but used to reorder the path

	If more than one mapping line refers to the same files, then the
	later mapping line overrides the earlier one, excluding any files
	from the earlier mapping.

	A mapping line that begins with a + overlays the later mapping
	on the earlier one: if files match both the earlier and later
	mappings, then the file matching the later mapping is used.
	Overlay mappings are only allowed on client views, and make it
	possible to map multiple server directories to the same client
	directory.

	A mapping line that begins with a - specifically excludes those
	files that match that mapping.

    add -- Open a new file to add it to the depot

    p4 add [ -c changelist# ] [ -f -n ] [ -t filetype ] file ...

	Open a new file for adding to the depot.  If the file exists
	on the client it is read to determine if it is text or binary.
	If it does not exist it is assumed to be text.  The file must
	either not exist in the depot, or it must be deleted at the
	current head revision.  Files may be deleted and re-added.

	If the -c flag is given the open files are associated with the
	specified pending changelist number; otherwise the open files are
	associated with the default changelist.

	If file is already open it is moved into the specified pending
	changelist.  It is not permissible to reopen a file for add unless
	it was already open for add.

	If -t filetype is given, the file is added as that filetype.
	Without -t '<a href="#add">p4 add</a>' looks for a filetype using the name-to-type
	mapping table managed by '<a href="typemap">p4 typemap</a>'.  For a default '<a href="add">p4 add</a>'
	senses the filetype by examining the file's contents and execute
	permission bit.  If the filetype given by -t or in the typemap
	table is a partial filetype, that partial filetype will modify
	the filetype sensed by '<a href="add">p4 add</a>'.
	See '<a href="#filetypes">p4 help filetypes</a>'.

	If the -f flag is given then filenames that contain wildcards are
	permitted.  Filenames added to the repository that contain these
	special wildcard characters '@', '#', '%' or '*' will have those
	characters formatted into ascii hexadecimal representation.  The
	only way of referring to those files once added will be to use the
	formatted version, the local filesystem name will not be recognized.

	The -n flag displays what would be opened for add without actually
	changing any files or metadata.

    p4 admin stop
    p4 admin updatespecdepot [ -a | -s type ]

	'p4 admin checkpoint' causes the server to take a checkpoint and
	to copy the journal to a numbered journal file.  It is equivalent
	to 'p4d -jc'.

	'p4 admin journal' causes the server to save the journal to a
	numbered journal file and then truncate it.  It is equivalent
	to 'p4d -jj'.

	The -z flag causes the checkpoint and saved journal to be saved in
	compressed (gzip) format, with the '.gz' suffix on the file names.

	If a prefix is specified, the files will be named prefix.ckp.n and
	prefix.jnl.n respectively, where n is a sequence number. Without
	prefix, the default filenames checkpoint.n and journal.n will be
	used.

	'p4 admin dbstat' outputs simple statistics for a database table.
	The -h flag outputs a little histogram showing distances between
	leaf pages,  for the purposes of anticipating disk seeks due to
	sequential database scans.  The -a flag outputs stats for all tables.
	Dbstat scans only the internal nodes pages of the file, not the leaf
	or overflow pages, and thus only reads 1-5% of the file.  Still, it
	locks out write access to the database table during its scan, and
	should be used with care.

	'p4 admin stop' stops the server, terminating any requests
	currently running.  It first locks the database to ensure that
	no updates are taking place, but otherwise is brutal as it does
	not wait for users to finish what they are doing.
	(For NT users, this will work whether you are running Perforce
	as a server or a service.)

	'p4 admin updatespecdepot' causes the server to archive forms
	(client, depot, branch, label, typemap, group, user, job) into
	the spec depot.  If the '-a' flag is used then all of the form
	specification types are archived.  If the '-s' flag option is

    p4 client [ -f -t template ] [ name ]
    p4 client -d [ -f ] name
    p4 client -o [ -t template ] [ name ]
    p4 client -i [ -f ]

	With no argument 'p4 client' creates a new client view specification
	or edits an existing client specification.  The client name is taken
	from the environment variable $P4CLIENT if set, or else from the
	current host name.  The specification form is put into a temporary
	file and the editor (given by the environment variable $P4EDITOR)
	is invoked.  If a name is given, the specification of the named
	client is used.

	The specification form contains the following fields:

	Client:      The client name (read only.)

	Host:        If set, restricts access to the named host.
		     If unset, access is allowed from any host.

	Owner:       The user who created this client.  Can be changed.

	Update:      The date this specification was last modified.

	Access:      The date this client was last used in any way.

	Description: A short description of the client (optional).

	Root:        The root directory of the client file workspace
		     (given in local file system syntax), under which all
		     client files will be placed.  If you change this, you
		     must physically relocate any files as well.  The name
		     "null" may be used to allow files to be mapped to
		     multiple drives on Windows clients.

	AltRoots:    Up to two optional alternate client workspace roots.
		     The first of the main and alternate roots to match the
		     client program's current working directory is used;
		     if none matches the main root is used anyway.
		     'p4 info' reports the applicable root.

	Options:     Flags to change the client behavior.   The defaults
		     are marked with *.

		allwrite	Leaves all files writable on the client;
		noallwrite *	else only checked out files are writable.

		clobber		Allows 'p4 sync' to overwrite writable
		noclobber *	files on the client.

		compress 	Compresses data sent between the client
		nocompress *	and server to speed up slow connections.

		locked   	Allows only the client owner to use the
		unlocked *	client or change its specification.
				Prevents the client from being deleted.

		modtime  	Causes 'p4 sync' to preserve file
		nomodtime *	modification time from submitting client,
				as with files with +m type modifier.
				Otherwise modification time is left as
				when the file was fetched.

		rmdir		Makes 'p4 sync' attempt to delete a client
		normdir *	directory when all files are removed.

	SubmitOptions:  Flags to change submit behaviour.

		submitunchanged           All open files are submitted
		submitunchanged+reopen    (default).

		revertunchanged           Files that have content or type
		revertunchanged+reopen    changes are submitted. Unchanged
		                          files are reverted.

		leaveunchanged            Files that have content or type
		leaveunchanged+reopen     changes are submitted. Unchanged
		                          files are moved to the default
		                          changelist.

		              +reopen     appended to the submit option flag
		                          will cause submitted files to be
		                          reopened on the default changelist.

	LineEnd:    Set line ending character(s) for client text files.

		local		Use mode native to the client (default).
		unix		linefeed: UNIX style.
		mac		carriage return: Macintosh style.
		win		carriage return-linefeed: Windows style.
		share		hybrid: writes UNIX style but reads UNIX,
					Mac or Windows style.

	View:        A mapping from the files in the depot to files in the
		     client workspace.  This is the mechanism by which you
		     select what files you want on your client and where you
		     want them to be.  The default view maps all depot files
		     onto the client.  See '<a href="#views">p4 help views</a>' for view syntax.
		     A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.

	Note: changing the client root does not actually move the client
	files; you must relocate them yourself.  Similarly, changing
	the 'LineEnd' option does not actually update the client files;
	you can refresh them with 'p4 sync -f'.

	The -d flag causes the named client to be deleted, as long as it
	has no opened files.  The -f forces the delete.

	The -o flag causes the named client specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a client specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -t flag constructs the client's view by copying the named
	template client's view, instead of using the existing view or
	creating a new default view.  It also copies the client options
	from the template client.

	The -f flag can force the updating of locked clients; normally
	locked clients can only be modified by their owner.  -f also allows
	the last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin'
	access granted by 'p4 protect'.

<b>% p4 help depot</b>

    depot -- Create or edit a depot specification

    p4 depot name
    p4 depot -d name
    p4 depot -o name
    p4 depot -i

	Create a new depot specification or edit an existing depot
	specification. The specification form is put into a temporary
	file and the editor (given by the environment variable $P4EDITOR)
	is invoked.

	The depot specification form contains the following fields:

	Depot:       The name of the depot.  This cannot conflict with
		     any branch, client, or label name.

	Owner:       The user who created this depot.

	Date:        The date this specification was last modified.

	Description: A short description of the depot (optional).

	Type:        'local', 'remote', or 'spec'.

		     A 'local' depot (the default) is locally managed by
		     the server and occupies space in the server's root
		     directory.

		     A 'remote' depot is a reference to files in another
		     Perforce server.

		     A 'spec' depot automatically archives all edited
		     forms (branch, change, client, depot, group, job,
		     jobspec, protect, triggers, typemap, and user) into
		     special, read-only files.  The files are named
		     //depotname/formtype/name[suffix].  Updates to jobs
		     made by the 'p4 change', 'p4 fix', and 'p4 submit'
		     commands are also saved, but not other automatic
		     updates such as access times or opened files (for
		     changes).  There can be only one 'spec' depot.

	Address:     For remote depots, the $P4PORT (connection address)
		     of the remote server.

	Suffix:      For spec depots, the optional suffix (default '.p4s')
		     for the generated paths.

	Map:         Path translation information, in the form of a file
		     pattern with a single ... in it.  For local depots,
		     this path is relative to the server's root directory
		     (e.g. depot/...).  For remote depots, this path refers
		     to the remote server's namespace (e.g. //depot/...).

	The -d flag deletes the named depot.  If any files exist in the
	depot they must be removed first with 'p4 obliterate'.

	The -o flag causes the named depot specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a depot specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

<b>% p4 help diff</b>

    diff -- Display diff of client file with depot file

    p4 diff [ -d<flag> -f -m max -sa -sd -se -sl -sr -t ] [ file[rev] ... ]

	Run diff (on the client) of a client file against the corresponding
	revision in the depot. The file is only compared if the file is
	opened for edit or the revision provided with the file argument is
	not the same as the revision had by the client.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help specifying revisions.

	If no file argument is given, diff all open files.
	This can be used to view pending changelists.

	The -d<flag> passes a flag to the built-in diff routine to modify
	the output: -dn (RCS), -dc (context), -ds (summary), -du (unified),
	-db (ignore whitespace changes), -dw (ignore whitespace),
	-dl (ignore line endings).

	The -f flag forces a diff for every file, regardless of whether
	they are opened or if the client has the named revision.
	This can be used to verify the client contents.

	The -m max flag limits output to the first 'max' number of files.

	The -s flag reduces the output of diff to the names of files
	satisfying one of the following criteria:

		-sa     Opened files that are different from the revision
			in the depot, or missing.

		-sb     Opened for integrate files that have been resolved
			but have been modified after being resolved.

		-sd     Unopened files that are missing on the client.

		-se     Unopened files that are different from the revision
			in the depot.

		-sl	Every unopened file, along with the status of
			'same, 'diff', or 'missing' as compared to its
			revision in the depot.

		-sr     Opened files that are the same as the revision in the
			depot.

	The -t flag forces 'p4 diff' to diff even files with non-text
	(binary) types.

	If the environment variable $P4DIFF is set then the named program is
	used rather than the implementation of diff included in the client.
	The -d<flag>command can be used to pass arguments to the external
	program.  The -s flag is only implemented internally.
	The environment variable $P4DIFFUNICODE is used instead of $P4DIFF
	if the file being diffed is of a unicode type and the character
	set is passed as the first argument to that command.

    p4 diff2 [ -d<flag> -q -t -u ] file1 file2
    p4 diff2 [ -d<flag> -q -t -u ] -b branch [ [ file1 ] file2 ]

	Run diff (on the server) of two files in the depot.  Both files
	may optionally include a revision specification; the default is
	to compare the head revision.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help
	specifying revisions.  Wildcards may be used, but they must
	match between file1 and file2.  Note if using clients or labels
	as file arguments they must be preceeded with a file path
	e.g. //...@mylabel //...@yourlabel

	Diff2 introduces each diff with a header line of the form

		==== file1 (type1) - file2 (type2) ==== summary

	file1 or file2 may be '<none>', meaning that only one of the
	matched files actually exists at the given revision.   The
	summary is one of: 'identical' - file contents are identical and
	types are the same, 'types' - file contents are identical but
	the types are different, and 'content' - file contents are
	different.

	The -b flag causes diff2 to use the branch view to specify the
	pairs of files to compare.  If file arguments are also present, they
	can further limit the files and specify the revisions for comparison.
	Note that if only one file is given, it restricts the right-hand
	side of the branch view.

	The -d<flag> passes a flag to the built-in diff routine to modify
	the output: -dn (RCS), -dc (context), -ds (summary), -du (unified),
	-db (ignore whitespace changes), -dw (ignore whitespace).

	The -q suppresses the display of the header lines of files whose
	content and types are identical and suppresses the actual diff
	for all files.

	The -t flag forces 'p4 diff2' to diff even files with non-text
	(binary) types.

	The -u flag comes one step closer to patch-friendly output:  it
	uses the GNU diff -u format and displays only files that differ.
	The file names and dates are in Perforce syntax, but the output
	seems digestible by the ubiquitous patch program.

	List any directories matching the file pattern dir.  Because of

	Use the * wildcard instead.

	Perforce does not track directories per se, but instead considers
	a path a directory if there are any undeleted files with that path
	as a prefix.

	If the dir argument includes a revision range, then only directories
	with files of those revisions are listed.  Normally directories with
	any files are listed.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help specifying

	the file permission from read-only to read/write.

	If -c changelist# is given, the file is put into the pending

	'p4 change'.  Otherwise the file is opened in the 'default'
	(unnumbered) changelist.

	If -t filetype is given, the file is opened as that filetype.
	Otherwise, the filetype of the previous revision is reused.
	If the filetype given by -t is a partial filetype, that partial
	filetype is combined with the previous revision's filetype.
	See '<a href="#filetypes">p4 help filetypes</a>'.

	List the revision history of the files named, working backwards
	from the latest revision to the first.  If the file specification
	includes a revision, the command limits its output to revisions at
	or previous to the given revision

	The -i flag causes inherited file history to be displayed as well.
	That is, if a file was created by branching (using 'p4 integrate'),
	filelog lists the revisions of the file's ancestors up to the branch
	points that led to the specified revision.

	The -h flag causes filelog to display file content history instead
	of file name history.  The revisions that are listed include those
	of other files that were branched or copied (using 'p4 integrate'
	and 'p4 resolve -at') to the specified revision.  Revisions that
	were replaced by copying or branching are not displayed, even if
	they are in the history of the specified revision.

	The -t flag displays the time as well as the date.

	The -l flag produces long output with the full text of the

    flush -- synonym for 'sync -k'

    p4 sync [ -f -n -k ] [ file[revRange] ... ]
    p4 sync [ -n -p ] [ file[revRange] ... ]

	Sync updates the client workspace to reflect its current view (if
	it has changed) and the current contents of the depot (if it has
	changed).  The client view is used to map client file names to
	depot file names and vice versa.

	Sync adds files that are in the client view but which have not been
	retrieved before.  Sync deletes previously retrieved files which
	are no longer in the client view or have been deleted from the
	depot.  Sync updates files which are still in the client view and
	which have been updated in the depot.

	Normally, sync affects all files in the client workspace.  If file
	arguments are given, sync limits its operation to those files.
	The file arguments may contain wildcards.

	If the file argument includes a revision specifier, then the given
	revision is retrieved.  Normally, the head revision is retrieved.
	See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help specifying revisions.

	If the file argument includes a revision range specification, then
	only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
	highest revision in the range is used.

	Normally, sync will not clobber files in the client workspace that
	the user has made writable.  Setting the 'clobber' option in the
	client spec disables this safety check.

	The -f flag forces resynchronization even if the client already
	has the file, and clobbers writable files.  This flag doesn't affect
	open files.

	The -n flag causes sync not to update the client workspace, but to
	display what normally would be updated.

	The -k flag bypasses the client file update.  It can be used to
	make the server believe that a client workspace already has the
	file.  Typically this flag is used to correct the Perforce server
	when it is wrong about what files are on the client, use of this
	option can confuse the server if you are wrong about the client's
	contents.

	The -p flag populates the client workspace, but does not update the
	server to reflect those updates.  Any file that is already synced or
	opened will be bypassed with a warning message.  This option is very
	useful for build clients or when publishing content without the
	requirement of saving the client workspace state.

	Fstat is intended for programmatic interfaces into Perforce.  It
	dumps information about each file, with each item of information on

	The -m max flag limits output to the first 'max' number of files.

	The -c changelist# flag instructs fstat to display only files
	affected since the given changelist number.  This operation is
	much faster than using a revision range on the affected files.

	The -e changelist# flag instructs fstat to display only files
	affected by the given changelist number.  When used with the -W
	flag only pending changes will be considered, this is so that
	files opened for add will also be included.  This option will
	also display the change description.

	The -O option generates ancilliary output:

	        -Of     output all revisions for the given files (this
			option suppresses other* and resolve* fields)

	        -Ol     output a fileSize and digest field for each revision
			(this may be expensive to compute)

		-Op	output the local file path in both Perforce syntax
			(//client/) as 'clientFile' and host form as 'path'

	        -Or     output pending integration record information for
	                files opened on the current client

		-Os	exclude the local path output in host form

	The -R option limits output to specific files:

		-Rc	files mapped through the client view
		-Rh	files synced to the client
	        -Rn     files opened not at the head revision
		-Ro	files opened
	        -Rr     files opened that have been resolved
	        -Ru     files opened that need resolving

	For compatibility the following are also supported:

    group -- Change members of user group

    p4 group [ -a ] name
    p4 group -d [ -a ] name
    p4 group -o name
    p4 group -i [ -a ]

	Create a new user group or add/delete members from an existing
	group.  A group's members can be users and/or other groups
	(subgroups). The group specification form is put into a temporary
	file and the editor (given by the environment variable $P4EDITOR)
	is invoked.

	A group exists when it has any users or other groups in it, and
	ceases to exist if all users and groups in it are removed.

	Each group has MaxResults and MaxScanRows fields, which limit
	the data size for operations that the users in that group can
	perform.  For either field, 'unlimited' means no limit for that
	group.  An individual user's limit is the highest of any group
	with a limit to which he belongs, or unlimited if he belongs to
	no group with a limit.  See '<a href="#maxresults">p4 help maxresults</a>' for more
	information on MaxResults and MaxScanRows.

	Each group also has a Timeout field which represents the time
	(in seconds) of how long a 'p4 login' ticket remains valid. Note
	a value of zero is equivalent to no timeout. See '<a href="#login">p4 help login</a>'
	for more information.

	The -d flag deletes all users and groups from the named group, thus
	deleting the whole group.

	The -o flag causes the named group specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a group specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.  The new
	group specification entirely replaces the previous.

	The -a flag allows a user without 'super' access to modify the group
	only if that user is an 'owner' of that group. Group owners
	are specified in the 'Owners' field of the group spec.

	All commands that require access granted by 'p4 protect' consider
	a user's groups when calculating access levels.

	'p4 group' requires 'super' access granted by 'p4 protect' unless
	invoked with the '-a' flag by a qualified user.

    p4 integrate [ options ] -b branch -s fromFile[revRange] [ toFile ... ]

	options: -c changelist# -d -D<flag> -f -h -i -o -n -r -t -v

	'p4 integrate' stages change propagation from source files to
	target files, opening the target files in the client workspace.
	'p4 resolve' then merges content from the source files into the
	opened target files, and 'p4 submit' commits the opened files to
	the depot.  Integrations can be abandoned with 'p4 revert'.

	When 'p4 integrate' opens a target file in the client workspace,
	it chooses an appropriate action: 'branch' for new files, 
	'integrate' when the source file has changed, and 'delete' when
	the source file was deleted.  Open target files are left read-only
	in the client workspace.  'p4 edit' can downgrade a 'branch' to an
	'add' or an 'integrate' to an 'edit', making the file read-write.

	'p4 integrate' maintains integration history between files.  This
	eliminates duplicate integrations and minimizes file merges by
	telling 'p4 resolve' what to use as the merge base: generally the
	highest revision already integrated.  Integration history also
	prevents integrating back a pure, integration-only change.  Such
	a change is one that resulted from 'p4 resolve' without manually
	editing the file.  The search for integration history will include
	integrations indirectly through intermediate file branches
	The commands 'p4 integrated' and 'p4 filelog' display integration
	history.

	A branch view may be given directly on the command line by stating
	the source (from) and target (to) files, or indirectly by naming
	a stored branch view with -b branch.  A stored branch view may have
	many mappings, while a view on the command line can only have one.
	If a stored branch view is given, the target files and source
	files and revisions may be further limited on the command.

	If no file specification is given then the entire branch view is
	examined for needed integrations.  If a file specification is
	given, the integration is limited to only those target files.
	In both cases, the integration is also limited to those target
	files that are also in the client view.

	If no revision specification is given then all revisions of the
	source file are considered for integration.  If a single revision
	is given, then only revisions up to the given revision are included.
	If a pair of revisions is given (separated by a comma (,)) then
	only those revisions, inclusively, are integrated.  Note that the
	revision specification concerns the fromFile, but is attached to
	the toFile.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help specifying revisions.

	The -f flag forces integrate to act without regard for previous
	integration history.  Normally, integrate skips any file revisions
	already integrated.  Note: unless revRange is given as well, the -f
	flag will force 'p4 resolve' perform merges without a common base.
	To avoid this, use -f only to force integration of specific changes.

	If -c changelist# is given, the files are opened in the numbered
	pending changelist instead of the 'default' changelist.

	The -d and -Dx flags enable integrations around deleted revisions.
	Normally 'p4 integrate' avoids mixing outstanding edits with a
	deleted file.  -d sets -Dt -Ds -Di.

		-Dt     If the target file has been deleted and the source
			file has changed, will re-branch the source file
			on top of the target file.

		-Ds     If the source file has been deleted and the target
			file has changed, will delete the target file.

		-Di	If the source file has been deleted and re-added,
			will attempt to integrate all outstanding revisions
			of the file, including those revisions prior to the
			delete.  Normally 'p4 integrate' only considers
			revisions since the last add.

	The -h flag causes the target files to be left at the revision
	currently on the client (the '#have' revision). Normally, target
	files are automatically synced to the head revision by 'p4 integrate'.
	[Note that prior to 2002.1 files were never automatically synced by
	'p4 integrate'.]

	The -i flag enables integration between files that have no
	integration history.  Normally, 'p4 integrate' refuses to
	integrate changes if there is no prior integration history between
	the source and target, because it has no way of identifying the base
	for its merges.  The -i flag forces baseless merges and tells
	'p4 resolve' just to use the first, added revision as the base.

	The -o flag displays the base file name and revision which will
	be used in subsequent resolves if a resolve is needed.

	The -n flag displays what integrations would be necessary but does
	not schedule them.

	The -r flag reverses the mappings in the branch view, with the
	target files and source files exchanging place.  The -b branch flag
	is required.

	The -s fromFile[revRange] flag causes the branch view to work
	bidirectionally, where the scope of the command is limited to
	integrations whose 'from' files match fromFile[revRange].  If
	any toFiles are given, the scope is further limited to integrations
	whose 'to' files match them. When the -s fromFile[revRange] flag is
	used, -r is ignored, as are any revisions on toFile.  [The -s flag
	is not meant for end users.  It exists to support graphical client
	programs.]

	The -t flag makes the source file's filetype propagate to the target
	file.  Normally, the target file retain its previous filetype.
	Newly branched files always use the source file's filetype.  The
	filetype can still be changed before 'p4 submit' with 'p4 reopen'.

	The -v flag makes 'p4 integrate' work faster by not copying newly
	branched files to the client.  In this case, the files can be
	fetched with 'p4 sync' after they are submitted with 'submit'.
	[Note that this was the default behavior for newly branched files
	in release 97.2 and earlier.]

	Note: the syntax 'p4 integrate -b branch toFile[revRange]' is
	provided for backwards compatibility, but is confusing because
	it mixes the target file with the source revisions.

    p4 job [ -f ] [ jobName ]
    p4 job -d jobName
    p4 job -o [ jobName ]
    p4 job -i [ -f ]

	'p4 job' creates and edits job specifications using an ASCII form.
	A job is a defect, enhancement, or other unit of intended work.
	The 'p4 fix' command can associate changelists with jobs.

	With no arguments, 'p4 job' creates a blank job specification form
	and invokes the user's editor.  When the form is saved, a job name
	of the form jobNNNNNN is created.  If a jobName is given on the
	command line either that named job will be created or, if the job
	already exists, the job can be modified.

	As jobs are entered or updated, all fields are indexed for
	searching by 'p4 jobs'.  Text fields are broken into individual
	alphanumeric words (punctuation and whitespace are ignored) and
	each word is entered, case folded, into the word index.  Date
	fields are converted to an internal representation (seconds
	since 1970/01/01 00:00:00) and entered into the date index.

	The fields of a job are defined by the 'p4 jobspec' command.
	There is a simple default jobspec that is used if no explicit
	one has been defined.

	The -d flag deletes the named job, but only if it has no

	The -i flag causes a job specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -f flag allows otherwise read-only fields to be set.  The -f

<b>% p4 help jobspec</b>

    jobspec -- Edit the job template

    p4 jobspec
    p4 jobspec -o
    p4 jobspec -i

	Jobspec edits the template that specifies the format of jobs.
	This format is used by 'p4 job' when jobs are entered or updated,
	and by 'p4 jobs' and 'p4 describe' when jobs are displayed.

	Jobspec brings up a form with the following fields:

	   Fields:  A list of the fields maintained for each job, one
		    line per field.  Each line has five words: code, name,
		    data-type, len, and field-type.

		    'code' is a unique integer identifier for storing
			the data of the field.  Job codes must be between
			101 and 199.

		    'name' is the name of the field for the job.

		    'data-type' indicates the format of the field:

			word: a single word (any value)
			date: a date/time field
			select: one of a set of words
			line: a one-liner
			text: a block of text

		    'len' is the recommended character length of a
			display box for the field.  If 0, a text box is
			assumed.

		    'field-type' indicates how to handle the setting of
			the field:

			optional: no default, and not required to be present
			default: default provided, still not required
			required: default provided, value must be present
			once: set once to the default and never changed
			always: always set to the default when saving the
				form, adding or deleting fixes with 'p4 fix'
				or 'p4 changelist', or submitting a change
				associated with the job with 'p4 submit'.

	   Values:  A list of 'select' fields and the values those fields
		    can have.  Each line has two words: the field name and
		    the values list, with individual values separated by
		    '/' (no spaces).

	   Presets: A list of fields and their default values, for fields
		    whose 'setting' flag is other than 'optional'.  Each
		    line has two words: the field name and the default
		    value.  If the value has spaces, it must be enclosed
		    in double quotes.  The following special defaults are
		    recognized:

			$user: the user entering the job
			$now: the current date
			$blank: the words '<enter description here>'

	   Comments: textual comments to be included at the top of each
		    job specification, to help the user fill out the form.
		    Each line must begin with the comment character '#'.

	Certain field codes have special significance:

	    code 101, required: the job name
	    code 102, optional: the job status
	    code 103, optional: the user who created the job
	    code 104, optional: the date the job was created
	    code 105, optional: the description

	    If there is a job status field (102), 'p4 submit' and 'p4 fix'
	    will set it to 'closed' for any jobs being fixed by the change.

	    Fields 102-105 are used by 'p4 describe' and 'p4 jobs' to
	    display a job summary.  Any missing fields simply will not
	    appear in the summary line.

	    If field 105 is present, it is assumed to be a description,
	    which is used by 'p4 change' and 'p4 submit' to annotate the
	    list of jobs to be fixed by the change being created.

	When updating the jobspec after jobs have been entered, certain
	limitations apply:

	    Data is stored according to its code.  Fields can be renamed
	    by keeping the same code. Removing a code can abandon the
	    associated data stored for the code.

	    Changing the definition of a code (e.g. from 'text' to 'word')
	    can require users to bring jobs into the new format as they
	    are edited.

	The -o flag causes the job template to be written to the standard
	output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a job template to be read from the standard
	input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	'p4 jobspec' requires 'admin' access granted by 'p4 protect'.

		     on this label.

	Description: A short description of the label (optional).

	Options:     Flags to change the label behavior.

		locked   	Allows only the label owner to change its
				specification.  Prevents the label from
				being deleted.  Prohibits 'p4 labelsync'.

	Revision:    An optional revision specification for an automatic
		     label.  Note that this field must be quoted if it
		     contains the # (form comment) character.

	View:        A mapping to select files from the depot.
		     The default view selects all depot files.
		     See '<a href="#views">p4 help views</a>', but note that only the
		     left hand side of a mapping is used for labels.

	A label is a shorthand for referring to a collection of revisions.
	See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for information on using labels.  A label
	is either automatic or static.  An automatic label refers to the
	revisions given in the View: and Revision: fields.  A static label
	refers to the revisions associated with the label by the 'p4 tag'
	or 'p4 labelsync' commands.  A static label cannot have a Revision:
	field.

	Flag -d causes the named label to be deleted, as long as it is
	not locked.  The -f flag forces the delete.

	The -o flag causes the named label specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a label specification to be read from the

	The -t flag constructs the label's view by copying the named
	template label's view, instead of using the existing view or
	creating a new default view.  It also copies the label options
	from the template label.

	The -f flag can force the deletion of a label; normally locked
	labels can only be deleted by their owner.  -f also allows the
	last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin' access
	granted by 'p4 protect'.

<b>% p4 help labelsync</b>

    labelsync -- Synchronize label with the current client contents

    p4 labelsync [ -a -d -n ] -l label [ file[revRange] ... ]

	Labelsync causes the named label to reflect the current contents
	of the client.  It records the last revision of each file taken
	onto the client.  The label's name can subsequently be used in
	a revision specification as @label to refer to the revision of
	a file as stored in the label.

	Without a file argument, labelsync causes the label to reflect the
	contents of the whole client, by adding, deleting, and updating the
	label.  If a file is given, labelsync updates only that named file.

	If the file argument includes a revision specification, then that
	revision is used instead of the revision taken by the client.  If
	the revision specified is a deleted revision, then the label will
	include that deleted revision.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help
	specifying revisions.

	If the file argument includes a revision range specification, then
	only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
	highest revision in the range is used.

	The -a flag causes labelsync to add the named file to the label;
	no files will be deleted from the label.

	The -d deletes the named file from the label, regardless of revision.

	The -n flag lists how the label would be affected, but doesn't
	actually update the label.

	Only the owner of a label may run labelsync on that label.
	A label that has its Options: set to 'locked' cannot be updated.

    license -- Update or display the license file

    p4 license -o
    p4 license -i

	Update the Perforce license file.  This command requires that
	there is already a valid license file in the Perforce root
	directory.  Typically this command lets an administrator add
	extra licensed users to the Perforce server without having to
	shutdown the server and manually copy the license file in place.

	Most new license files obtained from Perforce can be installed
	with this command, except for when the IPAddress has changed. In
	that case the server will have to be stopped and restarted after
	the new license file has been manually copied.

	The -o flag causes the license file to be written to the standard
	output.

	The -i flag causes a new license file to be read from the standard
	input.

<b>% p4 help logger</b>

    logger -- Report what jobs and changelists have changed

    p4 logger [ -c sequence# ] [ -t counter ]

	Dumps the event log, which notes updates to changes and jobs, for
	use with defect tracking integration.  The event log is enabled
	by setting the counter 'logger' (to 0) with 'p4 counter'.  Each
	event has a sequence number.  The presence of an entry in the log
	doesn't guarantee that the named entity has changed.

	If a sequence# is given with -c, only events since that number are
	listed.  If a counter is given with -t, only events since the 
	number of that counter are listed.  If both are given, then the
	counter is updated to the sequence number and nothing is output.
	If the update brings the counter to the highest sequence number
	in the log, the log is cleared.  This generally means that only
	one user can really make use of this option.

	'p4 logger' is not meant as an end-user command.  It exists to

<b>% p4 help login</b>

    login -- Login to Perforce by obtaining a session ticket

    p4 login [ -a -p ] [ user ]
    p4 login [ -s ]

	The login command allows a user to access Perforce until either
	the session expires or the user issues a 'logout' command.

	When a user "logs in" to Perforce they are prompted for the users
	password, if they supply this correctly then they are issued with
	a ticket.  The ticket issued will expire after the default timeout
	value has been reached and is only good for the host machine that the
	'login' command was executed from (see below for exception).

	The ticket can be used anywhere that a password can be used.

	e.g.

	p4 -P <ticket value> changes -m1

	The -a flag causes the server to issue a ticket which is valid on
	all host machines.

	The -p flag just displays the ticket rather than storing it on the
	client machine.

	The -s flag shows the status of the current ticket (if there is one).

	Requesting a login of someone other than the current user requires
	'super' access granted by 'p4 protect'.  In this case 'p4 login' does
	not prompt for the users password.

	Monitor is an admin utility that allows the user to see what current
	p4 processes are running. Monitor tracks the Perforce processes in a
	special table, this table is constantly being updated so there is a
	potential minor performance impact. To make use of this command it
	is required that 'monitoring' be enabled through the monitor counter.

	'p4 monitor show' displays current process information; for each
	process the process-id, status (Running/Terminate), owner, command
	are listed per line of output.  The following flags require 'admin'
	access:

	    The -a flag includes the command args.

	    The -e flag includes the command environment; for each process
	    client application (if known), host address and client name are
	    shown.

	    The -l flag produces long output with the full username and full
	    argument list.

	'p4 monitor terminate [id]' marks the command specified by its 'id'
	for termination. This command requires 'admin' access.

	'p4 monitor clear [id|all]' removes the process record specified by
	its 'id' from the monitor table. All of the records are removed if the
	option 'all' is supplied instead of an 'id'. This may be required if
	for some reason commands are ending prematurely. This command requires
	'admin' access.

	Obliterate removes files and their history from the server in a
	way that they won't come back.  (See 'p4 delete' for the non-
	destructive way to delete a file.)  It retrieves space used by those
	files in the archive and then clears the files from all lists
	maintained by the server.  Files in client workspaces are not
	affected, except that Perforce will no longer recognize them
	as being under its control.

	Obliterate is aware of lazy copies made when 'p4 integrate' creates
	a branch, and will not remove copies still in use.  Because of this,
	obliterating files does not guarantee that the corresponding files in
	the archive will be removed.

	If the file argument has a revision, then only that revision is
	obliterated.  If the file argument has a revision range, then only
	the revisions in that range are obliterated.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>'

	locked.  If no file names are given, all files open in the current
	client workspace are listed.

	The -a flag lists opened files in all clients.  Normally only files

	'p4 passwd' sets the user's password on the server.

	Once a password is set for a user on the server, then in order for
	that user to invoke any Perforce client commands the same password
	must be set on the client in the environment variable $P4PASSWD.
	(On Windows, 'p4 passwd' sets this as well.)

	'p4 passwd' prompts for both the old password and the new password
	with character echoing turned off.  Setting the password to an
	empty string deletes the password.

	The -O flag provides the old password, avoiding prompting.

	The -P flag provides the new password, avoiding prompting.

	Setting the password of someone other than the current user

	Retrieve the contents of a depot file to the client's standard
	output.  The client's have list is not affected.  If file is
	specified as a client file name, the client view is used to
	find the corresponding depot file.

	If the file argument has a revision, then all files as of that
	revision are printed.  If the file argument has a revision range,
	then only files selected by that revision range are printed, and
	the highest revision in the range is used for each file.  Normally,
	the head revision is printed.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help
	specifying revisions.

	The -a flag prints all revisions within the specific range, rather
	than just the highest revision in the range.

	The -o localFile flag redirects the output to the named file on

<b>% p4 help resolve</b>

    resolve -- Merge open files with other revisions or files

    p4 resolve [ -af -am -as -at -ay -d<flag> -f -n -o -t -v ] [ file ... ]

	'p4 resolve' merges the content of source files into target
	files open in the client workspace, using an interactive dialog.
	'p4 resolve' only handles merges scheduled implicitly by 'p4 sync'
	or 'p4 submit' of a file opened at a revision other than the head
	or explicitly by 'p4 integrate'.  Once scheduled, 'p4 resolve'
	must perform the merges before the file can be committed with
	'p4 submit'.

	If no file is given, all files needing merging will be resolved.

	The merge process is a classic 3-way merge, with the participating
	files named (for better or for worse): 'yours' -- the target
	file open in the client workspace; 'theirs' -- the source file
	being merged from the depot; and 'base' -- the common ancestor,
	actually the highest revision of the source file not already
	merged into the target.

	For each file, 'p4 resolve' places a merge candidate into a
	temporary file in the client workspace and displays a summary line
	with the total number of sections of text changed from the base:

	  yours        change is only in your open revision
	  theirs       change is only in the source revision
	  both         same text added or changed in both
	  conflicts    conflicting changes between the yours and theirs

	If there are any conflicts, the merge candidate file will have
	conflict markers bracketing the alternative texts.  You must
	edit the file to resolve the conflicts and remove the markers.

	'p4 resolve' distinguishes among four potential merge results:
	entirely yours, entirely theirs, automated merge, or manually
	edited merge.  All but the last result in a pure merge: one that
	never needs integrating back to the source file.  'p4 resolve'
	includes a suggested merge result in []'s on its prompt line.

	After displaying the summary line, 'p4 resolve' prompts you for
	an action:

	  Accept:
	     at              Keep only changes to their file.
	     ay              Keep only changes to your file.
	   * am              Keep merged file.
	   * ae              Keep merged and edited file.
	   * a               Keep autoselected file.

	  Diff:
	   * dt              See their changes alone.
	   * dy              See your changes alone.
	   * dm              See merged changes.
	     d               Diff your file against merged file.

	     et              Edit their file (read only).
	     ey              Edit your file (read/write).
	   * e               Edit merged file (read/write).

	  Misc:
	   * m               Run '$P4MERGE base theirs yours merged'.
			     (Runs '$P4MERGEUNICODE charset base theirs
					yours merged' if set and the file
			      is a unicode file.)
	     s               Skip this file.
	     h               Print this help message.
	     ^C              Quit the resolve operation.

	Options marked (*) appear only for textual resolution.

	The 'merge' option allows you to invoke your own integration and
	conflict resolution utility (named in the $P4MERGE environment
	variable).  This utility is expected to replace the existing
	merged file with a new one.

	The -am flag puts 'p4 resolve' into automatic mode: if there are
	conflicts, the file is skipped; if there are no conflicts and
	yours hasn't changed it accepts theirs; if theirs hasn't changed
	it accepts yours; if both yours and theirs have changed it accepts
	the merge.  Files that have no base for merging (e.g. binary files)
	are always skipped.

	The -af flag forces 'p4 resolve' in automatic mode to accept the
	merged file even if there are conflicts.

	The -as flag performs a 'safe' automatic resolve, accepting only
	files that have either your changes or their changes, but not both.
	Files with changes to both yours and theirs are skipped.

	The -at and -ay flags perform an automatic resolve that skips the
	merging.  Instead it automatically accepts their (-at) or your (-ay)
	version of the file.  The -at flag should be used with care, as
	it overwrites any changes made to the file in the client workspace.

	The -d<flag> can be used to handle whitespace and line endings
	when merging files.  The -db flag ignores whitespace changes,
	the -dw flag ignores whitespace altogether, and the -dl flag ignores
	line endings when merging files. The flags are also passed to the
	diff options in the 'p4 resolve' dialog. Additional -d flags which
	modify the diff output but do not modify merge behavior include
	-dn (RCS), -dc (context), -ds (summary), and -du (unified). Note that
	'p4 resolve' will use text from the client file where the files
	differ only in whitespace.

	The -f flag allows previously resolved files to be resolved again.
	Normally, once files have been resolved then 'p4 resolve' won't
	display them again.

	The -n flag lists the merges which would be performed without
	actually doing them.

	The -o flag displays the base file name and revision which will
	be used during the the merge.

	The -t flag forces 'p4 resolve' to attempt a textual merge, even
	for files with non-text (binary) types.

	The -v flag causes 'p4 resolve' to put in markers for all changes,
	not just those in conflict.  The markers must be edited out before
	the merged file can be accepted.

	'p4 submit' commits a pending changelist and its files to the depot.

	With no argument 'p4 submit' attempts to submit all files in the

	The -f flag allows a submit option to be passed into submit which
	will override the one that is set in the client. See '<a href="#client">p4 help client</a>'
	for valid submit options.

	The -i flag causes a changelist specification (including files to be
	submitted) to be read from the standard input.  The user's editor
	is not invoked.

	The -r flag allows submitted files to remain open (on the client's
	default changelist) after the submit has completed.

	The -s flag extends the list of jobs to include the fix status
	for each job, which becomes the job's status when the changelist
	is committed.  See '<a href="#change">p4 help change</a>' for more notes on this option.

	Before committing a changelist submit locks all associated files not
	already locked.  If any file cannot be locked, or if the submit
	fails for any other reason the files are left open in a newly
	created pending changelist.

	Submit is guaranteed to be atomic.  Either all files will be
	updated in the depot as a unit or none will be.

<b>% p4 help sync</b>

    sync -- Synchronize the client with its view of the depot
    flush -- synonym for 'sync -k'

    p4 sync [ -f -n -k ] [ file[revRange] ... ]
    p4 sync [ -n -p ] [ file[revRange] ... ]

	Sync updates the client workspace to reflect its current view (if
	it has changed) and the current contents of the depot (if it has
	changed).  The client view is used to map client file names to
	depot file names and vice versa.

	Sync adds files that are in the client view but which have not been
	retrieved before.  Sync deletes previously retrieved files which
	are no longer in the client view or have been deleted from the
	depot.  Sync updates files which are still in the client view and
	which have been updated in the depot.

	Normally, sync affects all files in the client workspace.  If file
	arguments are given, sync limits its operation to those files.
	The file arguments may contain wildcards.

	If the file argument includes a revision specifier, then the given
	revision is retrieved.  Normally, the head revision is retrieved.
	See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help specifying revisions.

	If the file argument includes a revision range specification, then
	only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
	highest revision in the range is used.

	Normally, sync will not clobber files in the client workspace that
	the user has made writable.  Setting the 'clobber' option in the
	client spec disables this safety check.

	The -f flag forces resynchronization even if the client already
	has the file, and clobbers writable files.  This flag doesn't affect
	open files.

	The -n flag causes sync not to update the client workspace, but to
	display what normally would be updated.

	The -k flag bypasses the client file update.  It can be used to
	make the server believe that a client workspace already has the
	file.  Typically this flag is used to correct the Perforce server
	when it is wrong about what files are on the client, use of this
	option can confuse the server if you are wrong about the client's
	contents.

	The -p flag populates the client workspace, but does not update the
	server to reflect those updates.  Any file that is already synced or
	opened will be bypassed with a warning message.  This option is very
	useful for build clients or when publishing content without the
	requirement of saving the client workspace state.

<b>% p4 help tag</b>

    tag -- Tag files with a label

    p4 tag [ -d -n ] -l label file[revRange] ...

	Tag associates the named label with the file revisions indicated
	by the file argument.  Once file revisions are tagged with a
	label, revision specifications of the form '@label' can be used
	to refer to them.

	If the file argument does not include a revision specification,
	the head revisions will be tagged.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>'
	for revision specification options.

	If the file argument includes a revision range specification,
	only the files with revisions in that range will be tagged.
	Files with more than one revision in the range will be tagged
	at the highest revision.

	The -d deletes the association between the specified files and
	the label, regardless of revision.

	The -n flag lists the files that would be tagged, but doesn't
	actually do anything.

	Tag can be used with an existing label (see '<a href="#labels">p4 help labels</a>')
	or with a new one.  An existing label may be used only by its
	owner, but only if it is unlocked. (See '<a href="#label">p4 help label</a>').

<b>% p4 help triggers</b>

    triggers -- Modify list of pre-submit and form-validating triggers

    p4 triggers
    p4 triggers -o
    p4 triggers -i

	'p4 triggers' edits the table of pre-submit, form-validating and
	external-authentication triggers.

	Triggers are administrator-defined commands that the server runs
	to perform the following:

	Validate changelist submissions.

	    The server runs changelist triggers either before the
	    file transfer, between file transfer and changelist commit,
	    or after the commit.

	Manipulate and validate forms.

	    The server runs form-validating triggers either between
	    generating and outputting the form, between inputting and
	    parsing the form, between parsing and saving the form, or 
	    when deleting the form.

	Authenticate or change a user password.

	    The server runs authentication triggers to either validate
	    a user password during login or when setting a new password.

	The trigger form has a single entry 'Triggers', followed by any
	number of trigger lines.  Triggers are executed in the order listed
	and if a trigger fails subsequent triggers are not run.  A trigger
	succeeds if the executed command exits 0 and fails otherwise.
	Normally the failure of a trigger prevents the operation from
	completing, except for the commit triggers which run after the
	operation is complete.

	If the trigger command succeeds, its standard output is sent to the
	client as an unadorned message.  If the command fails, its standard
	output (not error output) is sent to the client as the text of a
	trigger failure error message.

	Each trigger line contains a trigger name, a trigger type, a depot
	file path pattern or form type, and a command to run:

	Name:   The name of the trigger.  A run of the same trigger
		name on contiguous lines is treated as a single trigger,
		so that multiple paths may be specified.  Only the
		command of the first such trigger line is used.

	Type:	When the trigger is to execute:

		change-submit:
		    Execute pre-submit trigger after changelist has been
		    created and files locked but prior to file transfer.

		change-content:
		    Execute mid-submit trigger after file transfer but prior
		    to commit.  Files can be accessed by the 'p4 diff2',
		    'p4 files', 'p4 fstat', and 'p4 print' commands using
		    the revision specification '@=change', where 'change' is
		    the pending changelist number passed as %changelist%.

		change-commit:
		    Execute post-submit trigger after changelist commit.

		fix-add:
		    Execute fix trigger prior to adding a fix.  The special
		    variable %jobs% is available for expansion and must be
		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one
		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix' command.

		fix-delete:
		    Execute fix trigger prior to deleting a fix.  The special
		    variable %jobs% is available for expansion and must be
		    the last argument to the trigger as it expands to one
		    argument for each job listed on the 'p4 fix -d' command.

		form-out:
		    Execute form trigger on generation of form.	 Trigger may
		    modify form.

		form-in:
		    Execute form trigger on input of form before its contents
		    are parsed and validated.  Trigger may modify form.

		form-save:
		    Execute form trigger prior to save of form	after its
		    contents are parsed.

		form-commit:
		    Execute form trigger after it has been committed allowing
		    access to automatically generated fields (jobname, dates
		    etc).  It cannot modify the form.  This trigger for job
		    forms is run by 'p4 job' as well as by 'p4 fix' (after
		    the status is updated), 'p4 change' (if the job is added
		    or deleted) and 'p4 submit' (if the job is associated with
		    the change).  The 'form-commit' trigger has access to the
		    new job name created with 'p4 job', while the 'form-in'
		    and 'form-save' triggers are run before the job name is
		    created.  The special variable %action% is available for
		    expansion on the job 'form-commit' trigger command line.

		form-delete:
		    Execute form trigger prior to delete of form after its
		    contents are parsed.

		auth-check:
		    Execute an authentication check trigger to verify a user's
		    password against an external password manager during login
		    or when setting a new password.

		auth-set:
		    Execute an authentication set trigger to send a new password
		    to an external password manager.

	Path:   For change triggers, a file pattern to match files in the
		changelist.  This file pattern may be an exclusion mapping
		(-pattern) to exclude files.  For form triggers, the name
		of form (branch, client, etc).  For fix triggers (fix) is
		required as the path value,  for authentication triggers
		(auth) must be set.  Note that triggers on the 'p4 triggers'
		command are ignored.

	Command: The OS command to run for validation.  If the command
		contains spaces, the whole command must be quoted.  The
		The following variables are expanded in the command string:

		    %client% -- the client issuing the command
		    %clienthost% -- the hostname of the client
		    %clientip% -- the IP address of the client
		    %serverhost% -- the hostname of the server
		    %serverip% -- the IP address of the server
		    %serverport% -- the IP address:port of the server
		    %serverroot% -- the value of the server's $P4ROOT
		    %user% -- the user issuing the command

		    %changelist% -- the changelist being submitted

		    %formfile% -- path to temp file containing form
		    %formname% -- the form's name (branch name, etc)
		    %formtype% -- the type of form (branch, etc)

		More information can be gathered about the changelist
		being submitted by running 'p4 describe %changelist%'.

	The -o flag causes the trigger table to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes the trigger table to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

<b>% p4 help typemap</b>

    typemap -- Modify the file name-to-type mapping table

    p4 typemap
    p4 typemap -o

	'p4 typemap' edits a name-to-type mapping table for 'p4 add',
	which consults the table to select a file's filetype based on
	its name.

	The typemap form has a single entry 'TypeMap', followed by any
	number of typemap lines.  Each typemap line contains a filetype
	and a depot file path pattern:

	Filetype:   See '<a href="#filetypes">p4 help filetypes</a>' for a list of valid filetypes.

	Path:       Names to be mapped to the filetype.  This is a file
		    pattern and may be an exclusion mapping (-pattern)
		    to exclude files.  Note to match all files anywhere
		    in the depot hierarchy, the pattern must begin with
		    //..., and to match any file with a given suffix you
		    must either specify '//.../*.suffix' or '//....suffix'
		    (four dots).

	As with all mappings, later entries override earlier entries.
	If no matching entry is found in the table, 'p4 add' senses the
	file's filetype by examining the file's contents and execution
	permission bits.

	The -o flag causes the typemap table to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes the typemap table to be read from the

	Create a new user specification or edit an existing user
	specification. The specification form is put into a temporary
	file and the editor (given by the environment variable $P4EDITOR)
	is invoked.

	Normally, a user specification is created automatically the
	first time the user invokes any client command that can update
	the depot.  The 'p4 user' command is generally used to edit the
	user's reviewing subscription list for change review.

	The user specification form contains the following fields:

	User:        The user name (read only).

	Email:       The user's email address (user@client default).

	Update:      The date the specification was last modified (read only).

	Access:      The date the user last issued a client command.

	FullName:    The user's real name.

	JobView:     Selects jobs to be presented at changelist creation.
		     These are the jobs that can be closed automatically
		     upon changelist submission.  See '<a href="#jobview">p4 help jobview</a>'
		     for a description of jobview syntax.

	Reviews:     The subscription list for change review.  You may
		     use wildcards:
			 ...            matches any characters including /
			 *              matches any character except /
		     There may be any number of review lines.

	Password:    The user's password.  See also '<a href="#passwd">p4 help passwd</a>'.

	The -d flag deletes the named user, but only if the user has no
	opened files.

	The -o flag causes the named user specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a user specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -f flag can force the creation, update or deletion of any

<b>% p4 help verify</b>

    verify -- Verify that the server archives are intact

    p4 verify [ -m maxRevs -q -u -v ] file[revRange] ...

	'p4 verify' reports for each revision of the named files the
	revision specific information and an MD5 digest (fingerprint)
	of the revision's contents.  See '<a href="#revisions">p4 help revisions</a>' for help
	specifying revisions.

	By default, 'p4 verify' computes and displays the digest of each
	revision.  If a revision cannot be reproduced (e.g. if the file
	is missing from the archive), the revision's output line ends with
	MISSING!  If there is a saved digest, 'p4 verify' compares it with
	the computed one.  If they differ the output line ends with BAD!

	The -m max flag limits verify to 'max' revisions.

	The -u flag causes 'p4 verify' to compute and save the digest
	for each revision that has no saved digest.  Revisions already
	with saved digests are skipped.

	The -v flag forces 'p4 verify' to compute and save the digest
	for each revision, even if it already has a saved digest.  This
	can be used to update the saved digest if the archive was changed
	deliberately.

	The -q flag instructs 'p4 verify' to operate quietly.  The only
	output would be errors from mismatched digests or errors due to
	unreproducible revisions.

	The following commands will compute digests for revisions without
	saved digests and then verify the first and head revisions of all
	files.  Verifying revision #1 is useful for text files because
	of their reverse delta storage format: corruption of any revision
	will be reflected in revision #1.

		p4 verify -qu //...
		p4 verify -q #1,#1
		p4 verify -q #head,#head

	Saved digests are also used by 'p4 diff' to avoid having to
	compute them each time.

	With no argument 'p4 client' creates a new client view specification
	or edits an existing client specification.  The client name is taken
	from the environment variable $P4CLIENT if set, or else from the
	current host name.  The specification form is put into a temporary
	file and the editor (given by the environment variable $P4EDITOR)
	is invoked.  If a name is given, the specification of the named
	client is used.

	The specification form contains the following fields:

	Client:      The client name (read only.)

	Host:        If set, restricts access to the named host.
		     If unset, access is allowed from any host.

	Owner:       The user who created this client.  Can be changed.

	Update:      The date this specification was last modified.

	Access:      The date this client was last used in any way.

	Description: A short description of the client (optional).

	Root:        The root directory of the client file workspace
		     (given in local file system syntax), under which all
		     client files will be placed.  If you change this, you
		     must physically relocate any files as well.  The name
		     "null" may be used to allow files to be mapped to
		     multiple drives on Windows clients.

	AltRoots:    Up to two optional alternate client workspace roots.
		     The first of the main and alternate roots to match the
		     client program's current working directory is used;
		     if none matches the main root is used anyway.
		     'p4 info' reports the applicable root.

	Options:     Flags to change the client behavior.   The defaults
		     are marked with *.

		allwrite	Leaves all files writable on the client;
		noallwrite *	else only checked out files are writable.

		clobber		Allows 'p4 sync' to overwrite writable
		noclobber *	files on the client.

		compress 	Compresses data sent between the client
		nocompress *	and server to speed up slow connections.

		locked   	Allows only the client owner to use the
		unlocked *	client or change its specification.
				Prevents the client from being deleted.

		modtime  	Causes 'p4 sync' to preserve file
		nomodtime *	modification time from submitting client,
				as with files with +m type modifier.
				Otherwise modification time is left as
				when the file was fetched.

		rmdir		Makes 'p4 sync' attempt to delete a client
		normdir *	directory when all files are removed.

	SubmitOptions:  Flags to change submit behaviour.

		submitunchanged           All open files are submitted
		submitunchanged+reopen    (default).

		revertunchanged           Files that have content or type
		revertunchanged+reopen    changes are submitted. Unchanged
		                          files are reverted.

		leaveunchanged            Files that have content or type
		leaveunchanged+reopen     changes are submitted. Unchanged
		                          files are moved to the default
		                          changelist.

		              +reopen     appended to the submit option flag
		                          will cause submitted files to be
		                          reopened on the default changelist.

	LineEnd:    Set line ending character(s) for client text files.

		local		Use mode native to the client (default).
		unix		linefeed: UNIX style.
		mac		carriage return: Macintosh style.
		win		carriage return-linefeed: Windows style.
		share		hybrid: writes UNIX style but reads UNIX,
					Mac or Windows style.

	View:        A mapping from the files in the depot to files in the
		     client workspace.  This is the mechanism by which you
		     select what files you want on your client and where you
		     want them to be.  The default view maps all depot files
		     onto the client.  See '<a href="#views">p4 help views</a>' for view syntax.
		     A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.

	Note: changing the client root does not actually move the client
	files; you must relocate them yourself.  Similarly, changing
	the 'LineEnd' option does not actually update the client files;
	you can refresh them with 'p4 sync -f'.

	The -d flag causes the named client to be deleted, as long as it
	has no opened files.  The -f forces the delete.

	The -o flag causes the named client specification to be written
	to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -i flag causes a client specification to be read from the
	standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

	The -t flag constructs the client's view by copying the named
	template client's view, instead of using the existing view or
	creating a new default view.  It also copies the client options
	from the template client.

	The -f flag can force the updating of locked clients; normally
	locked clients can only be modified by their owner.  -f also allows
	the last modified date to be set.  The -f flag requires 'admin'
	access granted by 'p4 protect'.

Still to be done:<br>
1. More cross referencing. (including environment strings)<br>
2. Some testing and third-party feedback (any volunteers?)<br>
<br>
It would be really cool to have a script to generate this HTML file (from the output of the p4 command).  This would be quite a challenge - however it would make it easy to maintain this file with changes to Perforce.  Any volunteers?
