Atomical is a project between Fabio, Robin and Andre.

Qt2
---

At the moment, all I've done is to get the Qt/OpenGL/hellogl sample and make a few little changes.
It should compile, build and run on Windows/Mac/Linux.

UI
--
Mouse:             rotate the view
MouseWheel:        zoom in/out
MouseWheel+Shift:  Rotate the Q in the view
To quit:           Q or q or Escape
