# Cocoa Tutorials #
This project is a collection of tutorials about Cocoa and Objective-C.  The project has been underway since around March 2010 and the code and articles (PDFs) are available at http://clanmills.com/articles/cocoatutorials/

I've found Cocoa rather difficult to learn and from my experience on http://cocoaforum.com I believe many new users find Cocoa quite difficult at first.  These tutorials have mostly been written in response to matters discussed on the forum and are aimed at new users.

I'd like to encourage new users to stay the course.  Cocoa is a very nice environment and has a rich set of Frameworks to make you very productive once you've learned how the system works.  The system also uses very good design patterns which lead to efficient and versatile code.

I've decided to host this with Google code to encourage others to contribute.  New tutorials and corrections to existing works are welcome.

# What's Cocoa ? #

Cocoa is a software framework in MacOSX for programming applications and system code. It's not easy to sum up exactly what Cocoa is. I think the best way to explain it to say it's the gateway to Apple's technology. The iOS SDK is provided in Cocoa and is used to program application for the iPhone, iTouch and iPad.  Cocoa is also used to program Mac computers running MacOS-X.

These tutorials are about Cocoa and Obj/C which is the most common way to use Cocoa. I have never used the language bindings provided for Python and Ruby.

I've been quite active recently on a web forum http://cocoaforum.com. Almost all the visitors are new to Cocoa and I like writing little example programs to help explain the system. The tutorials here are based on conversations I've enjoyed with folks on this subject. I hope you find them useful.

I've uploaded 14 tutorials:

|  **Clock4** | This is a very simple tutorial | **console** | linking libraries and frameworks |
|:------------|:-------------------------------|:------------|:---------------------------------|
| **BYOB** | Build your own browser (easy) | **Obj-C and C and C++** | mixing languages |
|  **Quartz Clock** | this is fun (at least I think so) | **ix - Icon Extractor** | Converting graphics to PDF |
|  **Listen** | Speech synthesizer and recognizer | **Diary** | Typical data grid application |
|  **Regular Expressions** | Adding Regular Expressions to NSString  | **Address Book** | Core Data App (work in progress) |

The other 4 tutorials deal with documents and data.

I have code written for tutorials about Memory Management, Client-Server, HTTP, Bindings, Nibs, Graphics, Preference Panes and Dates.  I've simply haven't had time to write the documentation.
