2013-05-10&11:
+ Implementing the http post write for HttpIo class
+ Investigating about ssh.

2013-05-9:
+ Allow extract thumbnails, datasets into local files ... with RemoteIo (old bugs - I have just realized that)
+ Fix the curl_version_info in version.cpp on cygwin
+ Refactor remoteio.sh, httpio.sh.
+ Add test scripts for http post write access.
+ Build on different platforms:
   + CMake, ./configure : OK on MAC
   + CMake, ./configure : OK on AWS Ubuntu
   + ./configure: OK on AWS Windows
      CMake: running now
   + msvs2010 : not tested

2013-05-8:
+ Testing write access (HTTP POST), it works well with JPG images.
+ sftp is now ok on ubuntu aws machine.
+ Modifying remoteio.sh. Everything seemed OK until I realized that curl_version_info function gets problems on cygwin.

          Built sample apps
          Linked http.cpp with libcurl and got HTTP/Get to work

2013-05-11
BVT:      Now works on Cygwin on Desktop
          Issue with Cygwin build failing on ass-windows referred to Robin for investigation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Robin
R3:       Think about how to get the metadata at the end of a BIG file.

TODO: Tuan
T1:       Investigate setting up the IIS on windows EC2
T2:       Add make testt to only run httpiotest.sh and remoteiotest.sh [See R2]
T3:	  "Make doc"
T4:	  "HTTP POST" in Robin's code
T5:	  Documenting the JPEG
T6:	  SSH

Notes about tasks
-----------------

R2/T2     (no, not R2D2 - he was in StarWars)
          It'd be quick to be able to do $ make ; $ make testt  (30 seconds)
          instead of $ make ; sudo make ; make samples ; make tests (2 minutes)
          Puzzle: How does ./configure ; make create bin/.libs/exiv2(.exe) and bin/exiv2 (script) ?

Completed tasks
---------------
R1:[DONE] Document/explain getopt_long
R2:[DONE] Get make to build bin/.libs/httptest and bin/.libs/remotetest [See T2]
T1:[DONE]
T2:[DONE] $ make; $ make testx and $make tests
T4:[DONE]
