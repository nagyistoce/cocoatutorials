2013-05-10&11:
+ Implementing the http post write for HttpIo class
+ Investigating about ssh.

2013-05-9:
+ Allow extract thumbnails, datasets into local files ... with RemoteIo (old bugs - I have just realized that)
+ Fix the curl_version_info in version.cpp on cygwin
+ Refactor remoteio.sh, httpio.sh.
+ Add test scripts for http post write access.
+ Build on different platforms:
   + CMake, ./configure : OK on MAC
   + CMake, ./configure : OK on AWS Ubuntu
   + ./configure: OK on AWS Windows
      CMake: running now
   + msvs2010 : not tested

2013-05-8:
+ Testing write access (HTTP POST), it works well with JPG images.
+ sftp is now ok on ubuntu aws machine.
+ Modifying remoteio.sh. Everything seemed OK until I realized that curl_version_info function gets problems on cygwin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Robin
R3:       Think about how to get the metadata at the end of a BIG file.
R4:       Http.cpp to handle chunk response.
R5:       msvc64/ssh support (and curl to use that for https and sftp)
R6:       SVN trunk integration support (email already sent to Andreas)
R8:       set up server/account with sftp credentials which deny ssh access

Robin plans to be in San Jose about 2013-07-12 through 2013-07-23 to work on:
1         0-23.1 release of Exiv2 (to be done on a branch on dev.exiv2.org)
2         msvc64 ssh support
3         integrating gsoc13 to trunk and testing

Robin will go to the UK for around 2013-07-23 until mid-October.
1         will be staying at his home in England.
2         will be in Scotland for a wedding on 2013-08-03
          will visit friends and family for several days before and after wedding
3         will take Mac Book and Sony Laptop (W7/Kubuntu) in England.

TODO: Tuan
T3:       "Make doc"
T5:       Documenting the JPEG
T6:       SSH support (done) and documented on on Wiki (not yet)
T7:       document EXIV2_xxx environment strings in use
T8:       Polish BVT (always lowest priority/background task)

Plan agreed in 1-to-1 on 2013-06-29
Week beginning:
2013-07-01 More testing (and maybe a little refactoring)
2013-07-08 Investigate Google Drive, Sky Drive, iCloud, AWS
2013-07-15 Integrate cocoatutorials/gsoc13 to trunk on dev.exiv2.org
2013-07-22 Documentation (make docs ; PNG ; JPG on Wiki)

Notes about tasks
-----------------

R2/T2     (no, not R2D2 - he was in StarWars)
          It'd be quick to be able to do $ make ; $ make testt  (30 seconds)
          instead of $ make ; sudo make ; make samples ; make tests (2 minutes)
          Puzzle: How does ./configure ; make create bin/.libs/exiv2(.exe) and bin/exiv2 (script) ?

Completed tasks
---------------
R1:[DONE] Document/explain getopt_long
R2:[DONE] Get make to build bin/.libs/httptest and bin/.libs/remotetest [See T2]
R7:[DONE] Review (and change) MSC_VER seek(uint64_t..) to seek(int64_t...)
T1:[DONE] Investigate setting up the IIS on windows EC2
T2:[DONE] $ make; $ make testx and $make tests
T4:[DONE] "HTTP POST" in Robin's code
T8:[DONE] Refactor basicio.cpp (after everything else working and testable).
