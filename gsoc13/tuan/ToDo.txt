          Issue with Cygwin build failing on ass-windows referred to Robin for investigation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Robin
R2:       Get make to build bin/.libs/httptest and bin/.libs/remotetest [See T2]
R3:       Think about how to get the metadata at the end of a BIG file.

TODO: Tuan
T1:       Investigate setting up the IIS on windows EC2
T2:       Add make testt to only run httpiotest.sh and remoteiotest.sh [See R2]

Notes about tasks
-----------------

R2/T2     (no, not R2D2 - he was in StarWars)
          It'd be quick to be able to do $ make ; $ make testt  (30 seconds)
          instead of $ make ; sudo make ; make samples ; make tests (2 minutes)
          Puzzle: How does ./configure ; make create bin/.libs/exiv2(.exe) and bin/exiv2 (script) ?
