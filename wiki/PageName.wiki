= Introduction =

Cocoa is a software framework in MacOSX for programming applications and system code. It's not easy to sum up exactly what Cocoa is. I think the best way to explain it to say it's the gateway to Apple's technology. The iPhone SDK is provided in Cocoa.

These tutorials are about Cocoa and Obj/C which is the most common way to use Cocoa. I have never used the language bindings provided for Python and Ruby.

I've been quite active recently on a web forum http://cocoaforum.com. Almost all the visitors are new to Cocoa and I like writing little example programs to help explain the system. The tutorials here are based on conversations I've enjoyed with folks on this subject. I hope you find them useful.

At the moment, I've only uploaded two tutorials:

||  # *Clock* || this is a very simple tutorials ||
||  # *Quartz Clock* || this is fun (at least I think so) ||

I have about another 10 tutorials ready and available on http://clanmills.com/articles/cocoatutorials/ and I'll be uploading them in the next few days.

I have code written for about another 10 tutorials and I've been too busy to write the documentation.
