QtSee Project
-------------

TODO (in priorty order)
-----------------------

1 Get Alan engaged and active on the project.
2 Better photo experience better (zoom, pan etc)
3 Get the web server working
4 Figure out a lot more architecture

Diary

2011-01-22 Added File/Open to display directories of photos
2011-01-21 Bootstrapped the web-browser part in Qt (M/W/L)
2011-01-20 Wrote down objectives and searched for technology
2011-01-19 Agreed with Alan to do the project

Objectives
----------

I’ve got some definite ideas about what I’d like to achieve and these include:

1 Easy to use cross-platform photo browser/slide show/light table

2 Easy to script (in JavaScript or Python or something)
-	Publishing to the web (or Google WebAlbums,
    or PDF or whatever is done using a script)

3 Light table is also a collage maker
-	The light table will probably be implemented using WebKit/HTML5
-	The whole UI might even be implemented in WebKit/HTML5

4 Operates on the file system and stores the metadata in the photos themselves
(using the exiv2 library)
- No central database of photos (other than application preferences)

5 Installer for Windows, DMG Installer for Mac.  Don’t know what’s best for Unix

6 We need a test plan

7 Code is stored in google code using SVN

I’d like us to declare “job done” by the end of March.
I don’t want this to go on very long.  We both learn some tricks and drop it.

For the first couple of months, I’m going to put this into
code.google.com/p/cocoatutorials/QtSee

If we decide (around the end of March) to continue, we can open a new repository
using git and continue from there.  

Elements of Software Development
--------------------------------

 1 The IDEA
 2 Architecture
 3 Writing code
 4 Fixing bugs
 5 Porting
 6 Building
 7 Testing
 8 Installer
 9 Localization
10 Documentation
11 Supporting users

We're not going to deal with all of this.  We won't get much past item 3.

How to implement this 
---------------------

I’ve made two great discoveries.

1)	Qt-SDK’s demo program fancybrowser looks like to a good place to start

2)	Lighttpd.net – lightway, hi-performance web server
I’ve build and configured it to run on Windows (yeah!). 
I’ve got it serving the local copy of clanmills.com on localhost:3000

So the architecture is clear.
- QtSee will be a web browser and by default he browses localhost:3000
- 3000 will be a user preference.
- When the user wants to browse the photos in a directory
  Example: c:\Users\rmills\Documents\Dropbox\Photos\2011\RobinsBirthday
  The application will create a cached directory and browse
  the photos using the web browser and web server.

Once we’ve got the apparatus in place, most of the programming will be done in JavaScript (for the browser).  Provides QtScript (the JavaScript in WebKit) – so we can probably do the server side programming also in JavaScript.
