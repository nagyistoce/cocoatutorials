DOCUMENTATION="HardFeed  Version $VERSION

$USAGE

HardFeed copies all of the contents of a remote directory to the current 
directory using ftp.  It establishes an ftp connection to the remote 
site and it uses the ftp command \"ls\" to get a listing of the remote
directory.  The two required parameters are the remote sytstem and the user
name.  The optional third parameter is the remote directory to copy.  The 
default is just the home directory of the ftp account.

HardFeed will prompt you for the password.  This is very secure but it isn't
any good if you want to run HardFeed automatically. You can set the password in
the environment variable HARDFEED_P as an alternate.  HardFeed will set an
internal variable to the password and then clobber the variable HARDFEED_P,
since on some systems, the environment of another process can be displayed.
With most shells, you can also set an environment variable for one command
only, like this: \"HARDFEED_P=xyzzy HardFeed -dR ftpxy joeblow sourcedir\". 
A second alternative is to specify a \"password file\" with the -p option.  
Such a file contains, in plaintext, the password.  HardFeed will read the file
to get the password.  You must decide which option makes more sense in your
environment.

Only files are examined.  If we don't have a copy of the remote file, we 
will get it.  HardFeed will never overwrite an existing file system object
with one exception.  If you specify -f and we have both a remote file and a
local file, the timestamps are compared.  If the remote file is newer, a
retrieval attempt will be made.  The local file must be writable for this
to succeed.  For the timestamp compare to work, you and the remote system
must be in the same timezone.  (You can vary your environment to make this
true.)

Normally symbolic links are ignored. But with -s, we will attempt to create
a symlink with the same link data.  Even with -s, we will never overwrite
any existing object with a new symbolic link.  You will need to review any
symlinks created and probably correct them.  

Normally, directories are ignored.  If you specify -d, HardFeed will attempt
to create the directory locally.  But again, it will never overwrite an
existing object to create a directory.  If you specify -r, HardFeed will 
attempt to recurse into a directory and process all of the files there.  If
you use both -d and -r, it will copy an entire directory hierarchy.  But you
can leave off -d and only pre-create a few directories if you want.

HardFeed will attempt a chmod of any file or directory that it creates if you 
specify -m.  It will try to match the mode of the remote object.

HardFeed operates by establishing a co-process to the ftp command.  Normally,
the output from the co-process is sent to an un-named file in /tmp and
discarded.  If you want to capture this output, connect a file to fd 3 and
HardFeed will use it for this purpose.  From ksh the syntax is 3>file.  You 
can also do 3>&1 to see it real time during the run if you really want.

You can make HardFeed send the ftp co-process some extra commands after the
connection is established with -x.  

HardFeed gets a directory listing by sending a \"ls .\" command to the server.
Some servers will list dot files with this while others won't.  You can use the
-l option to change the command if your server needs a different one to do want
you want. -l \"ls -al\" is one example that I got to work with unix.

For a microsoft ftp server, I had some luck with:
 -l \"ls -la\" -x \"quote site dirstyle\"
Note that everything is transferred in binary mode.  -x ascii will switch
everything to ascii mode.  HardFeed supports embedded spaces in filenames.  User
names may be long and contain slashes. All of this may make it somewhat usable 
with microsoft ftp servers."
