ReadMe.txt
----------

This is a collection of scripts and stuff that I've collected
over the years.  Use at your own risk.

I'll probably get round to documenting some of this stuff
(or maybe I won't!)

make -B age     Age of file
make -B args    echo the arguments to stdout
make -B bom     writes a bom marker in a file
make -B cet     pipes stdin to the editor (in ce.cpp, which I haven't provided!)
make -B char    convert decimal to char
make -B crfile  something to do with cr and lf (can't remember)
make -B crlink  reverses the order of the ln -s target link to a more natural order
