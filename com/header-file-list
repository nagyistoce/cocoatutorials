COM: *** File: xdps_includes/sources/header-file-list ***
COM: 
COM: This file contains the list of all the header files in the xdps_includes
COM: package. It serves as the input file to the script:
COM: 
COM: .../xdps_includes/sources/update-includes
COM: 
COM: The purpose of the update-includes script is to provide a convenient
COM: way of keeping the header files in the xdps_includes package in sync
COM: with the corresponding header files in each OEM's X server build tree.
COM: 
COM: The advantages of maintaining copies of the X server header files in
COM: the xdps_includes package rather than having symbolic links pointing
COM: from the PostScript build area into an external OEM X-server tree are:
COM: 
COM: 1) The PostScript build tree is completely self-contained. It does not
COM:    depend on some external X-server build area (which may move or be
COM:    out-of-date).
COM: 
COM: 2) For each public PostScript release the state of the X-server header
COM:    files is preserved as a snapshot in  the xdps_includes package. It
COM:    is therefore easy to rebuild an earlier release without having to
COM:    find and bring online the particular X-server build tree that the
COM:    release depended on.
COM: 
COM: 3) This file (header-file-list) contains the exact list of the X-server
COM:    header files that the xdps product and packages depend on. This makes
COM:    it  a  lot  easier  to  troubleshoot  problems  with  the  PostScript
COM:    interpreter's interaction with the X server (because we know exactly
COM:    which header files we use for communication with the X server).
COM: 
COM: The update script (update-includes) ignores all blank lines in this file,
COM: and lines that begin with "COM:" so these comments will be ignored by the
COM: update script. The filenames in the list below all assume the prefix:
COM: 
COM: .../xdps_includes/sources/${X11_RELEASE}-${OS}/mit (for X11R5)
COM: .../xdps_includes/sources/${X11_RELEASE}-${OS}/xc  (for X11R6)
COM: 
COM: where ${X11_RELEASE}-${OS} is the sources sub-directory for each platform.
COM: 
COM: If more X server header files are needed in the future, just add the
COM: files to the lists below, and run the update-includes script for each
COM: platform. The update script takes no options. To run it, go to the
COM: xdps_includes sources directory and type:
COM:
COM: chmod +x ./update-includes
COM: ./update-includes
