4.00d Apr 10, 2001
 - fixed the damn Help problem again (I gotta setup a cvs server)

4.00d Mar 09, 2001
 - automachron now properly processes host names entered as IP
   addresses rather than host names.  It seems that on some
   windows platforms gethostbyname() works with a dotted IP while
   on others it does not.  Bad form apparently.  Mea culpa.

4.00c Jan 32, 2001
 - broadcast client mode was broken. fixed.
 - log output of the time differences was nonsensical.  fixed.

4.00b Jan 15, 2001
 - added startupSleep registry hack.  This is the number of seconds
 for which automachron will sleep before continuing with its startup.
 This can be used in situations where the network is not configured
 properly for an amount of time at startup.
